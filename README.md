This website is the result of transforming a design created by Yulko, which can be found at Dribbble - [Hello World Login Registration Form](https://dribbble.com/shots/2571146-Hello-World-Login-Registration-Form)
, into a web version using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

I would like to extend my gratitude to Yulko for this inspiring design. The site is a direct implementation of Yulko's design, with an effort to transform the design concept into a functional web version.

Although I did not originate the original design, my contribution lies in transforming the design into a website that is functional and accessible online. I had to make some adjustments to accommodate technical aspects, including differences in image assets, fonts, font colors, box shadow effects, and color variations.

There are several elements that I haven't implemented, such as interactivity and a responsive website. This is currently being addressed in stages because Yulko's design is only an image. Therefore, I looked for inspiration for its interactivity and responsive design, especially in mobile view, to improve its functionality.

My goal was to bring Yulko's brilliant design concept into the web space for effective user utilization.
